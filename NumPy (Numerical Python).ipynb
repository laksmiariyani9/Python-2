    "## NumPy (Numerical Python)\n",
    "- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",
    "  - Here are some key features and functionalities of NumPy:\n",
    "    - Arrays: NumPy provides an array object that is similar to Python lists but allows for more efficient storage and manipulation of data. These arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or multi-dimensional.\n",
    "    - Mathematical Functions: NumPy offers a wide range of mathematical functions that can operate element-wise on arrays, including trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, and statistical functions.\n",
    "    - Linear Algebra: NumPy has built-in functions for linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication, inversion, determinant calculation, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.\n",
    "    - Random Number Generation: NumPy includes functions to generate random numbers from various probability distributions.\n",
    "    - Broadcasting: NumPy allows for broadcasting, which is a powerful feature that enables operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes.\n",
    "    - Integration with C/C++ and Fortran: Many of NumPy's functions are implemented in C/C++ or Fortran, which allows for efficient computation."
